not using webdriver-manager. Using remote selenium hub




Based on http://www.protractortest.org/#/tutorial

I preferred using:
```
npm init
```
to create a package.json

also I've installed protractor using:
```
npm install protractor --save-dev
```
to avoid using a global one. Also I run tests using 
```
npm test
```
instead of calling protractor directly
